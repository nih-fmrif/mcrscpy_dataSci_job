The [Sections on Neural Function](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/snf/index.shtml) and 
[Fundamental Neuroscience](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/principal-investigators/ted-usdin.shtml) are seeking an individual who is to work at the interface 
of data science and neurobiological research. Capitalizing on recent advances in imaging-related technologies, NIMH researchers 
are analyzing brain circuits in large 3-dimensional volumes, including entire brains, at the level of individual neurons. Measuring 
patterns of neuronal activity and gene expression at the single cell level in such large volumes generates complex, multichannel 
datasets that can exceed 2 TB per experiment. Extracting information from these large datasets presents analytical challenges at 
multiple levels and requires adapting and optimizing methods for data handling (e.g. merging multiple views, spectral unmixing, 
spatial deconvolution, and segmentation) and analysis (e.g. correlation and cluster analysis, pattern recognition, etc.). In addition, 
correlating brain circuit activity with complex patterns of behavior, requires methods for automating behavioral characterization 
such as machine learning. 

The successful candidate shall:
* Work closely with neuroscientists to develop, write, and optimize programs for image and behavioral analysis.
* Assist scientists in performing analyses of imaging data on local [High Performance Compute cluster](http://hpc.nih.gov)
* Work closely with the larger [NIH Data Science Community](https://datascience.nih.gov/)

The successful candidate must have:
* Bachelorâ€™s or more advanced degree in a science/engineering discipline or equivalent experience.
* Experience with programming languages such as Matlab, Python, Java or C++.
* Familiarity with Linux and Windows Server operating systems and shell scripting.
* Experience with software for image or signal processing or related scientific research tools.
* Strong communications skills, both oral and written.
* Excellent analytical, organizational and time management skills.
* Knowledge or experience with machine learning would be advantageous

If you meet the requirements listed below and are passionate about applying the techniques of big data to 
push science forward, please contact Dr. Benjamin White (benjaminwhite@mail.nih.gov) or Dr. Ted Usdin (usdint@mail.nih.gov).

The National Institutes of Health is an equal opportunity employer. The candidate will be employed via a third party contractor.
